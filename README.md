# Notes

- Server side react rendering. Automatically creates routes for files dropped in pages folder.
- Comes with style jsx, dont need to use that. Can use Styled Components.
- Seems really good for getting a project up and running quick.
- This project used Bootstrap (actually Bootswatch) for quick styling. Think about using this more in the future.
- isomorphic-unfetch : npm module to run fetch on server
- Don't have to import React for each component with Next, it's just there!
